# Static Birthday Banner
This repository contains assets for a static webpage serving as a digital birthday banner.

The webpage is currently self-contained within this repository, that is, images, fonts, and any other assets required for building the webpage exist within the repository itself.

So as not to perpetuate (some mildly embarrassing) images of friends within my GitHub account, and in the commit history, this serves as a template I come to on each birthday. The repository is cloned, personalized, then published back to GitHub under another name and deployed via GitHub pages. Personalized repositories are deleted the day after each birthday.

**Please feel welcome to clone these materials and personalize for your own friends and family.**

Ideally, images of people should be stored in a secure third party location, outside of the repository. These should be loaded into the GitHub pages deployment via an API or similar, while keys/passwords should be securely stored as repository secrets. Such an arrangement would necessitate the use of a GitHub Actions pipeline for deployment to handle secret variables.
